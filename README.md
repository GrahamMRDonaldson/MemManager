# MemManager
Memory Management for Window's Processes

This project was originally meant for simply viewing memory of various processes, but evolved to being able to write to memory, and read from that memory as various data types. This was done because it simply seemed interesting, and because the way I was doing it before was inefficeint (passing references instead of returning templates), I decided to upload a somewhat streamlined way of reading/writing to a processes memory. This was written in C++, using Visual Studio 2019.
